# Documentation for Student Debt Monitor (SDM)

## Research plan for  *Student Debt Monitor (SDM)*

**Idea brief**: *Student Debt Monitor (SDM)* is a web application that will be designed specifically for school owners and administrative heads of primary and secondary schools in mainland Lagos, Nigeria to enable them to see the debt status of students before granting them admission into their schools. However, this platform will also give access to parents/guardians and their wards to enable them to challenge the contents or make comments on the posts relating to them in the event that they were tagged as debtors wrongly. This idea is borne out of the desire to assist school owners to track potential debtors and admitting only those with good credit standing into their institutions. This platform will not only show the status of the debtors but allow these debtors to make their claims and challenge the data or debt against their name with evidence of payment. This web application gives access to schools in a particular locality (Lagos Mainland) and a directory of students/pupils owing them to prevent them from registering into other schools. The goal of using this locality (mainland Lagos) and school class (primary and secondary) as a benchmark is to enable us to reach the desired target audience to uncover the in-depth pain points of the users while focusing on a smaller group to provide a comprehensive research output. Also, the issue of parents or guardians withdrawing their child or ward from one school to another one is more prevalent within this school class (primary and secondary) than in other tertiary institutions (universities, colleges, and polytechnics).

**Role:** Product Designer

## Research Background

School owners have had a bad taste in their mouths owing to the unhealthy attitude of some parents to not paying the fees due to them for the tutelage and welfare of their child(ren)/wards. These parents are known to be perennial debtors and have perfected the act of owing schools and leaving without settling their bills; rather, they end up in other schools where they probably will do the same thing over again. Most schools in Nigeria, particularly privately owned schools depend on the tuition and other fees paid by their students. While the payment of fees ensures a seamless academic year for the students, some parents are held back from fulfilling this obligation due to other pressing needs, eventualities, or life occurrences. In extreme cases, parents tend to withdraw their children from school when the unpaid bills are becoming overwhelming and decide to enroll their child or children into different schools just to waive the previous debt owed in the previous school. This can lead to late and non-payment of teachers’ salaries, and the inability to provide students with good facilities for learning.

To therefore avoid this strain, which mostly affects the child in the long run and also the school in terms of consistent deliverables, it is important for the debt status of students to be monitored to prevent the recurrence of unpaid tuition debt in schools before withdrawal. The aim of this research is to understand the unique challenges school owners face as a result of unpaid debts of students and to gather as much information as possible to help with creating a needed possibly lasting change/solution to the challenge experienced by school owners and administrators.

**Problem Statement:** The UNICEF Global report of 2021 confirms that about 10.5 million children aged 5-14 years in Nigeria are not in school even though primary education is compulsory. This claim is supported by the InfoGuide statistics on Nigeria that asserts that 86.9 million Nigerians live in extreme poverty and do not have the means to fund basic education. No doubt, the after effect of this pitiable state in the financial capability of most households in Nigeria is to avoid school entirely or at most, attend one without paying for tuition, to the detriment of school owners, particularly as the latter depends solely on the remittance of these fees to cater to the administrative duties of the school and salaries of teachers. The ability of a family to meet tuition fee/school fees payments can deteriorate very rapidly for a variety of reasons. This can negatively affect the student’s education as well as the school’s or college’s financial position, particularly where budgets have already been set. In some cases, however, poverty is a secondary consideration or none at all as some parents/guardians choose to deliberately owe the tuition fees, and rather than paying, they switch the schools of their wards until they complete their basic education. The price that these children from poor homes pay is already high since the majority of them cannot afford basic education, however, the price proprietors pay are even higher as they do not only lose their source of livelihood but their business and the trust of their employees who work as teachers in these schools. Further research has also shown that unpaid fees reflect the physical structure of the school in terms of facilities. This lack of facilities limits the ability of a student to achieve various learning and extracurricular activities and has a negative impact on teachers' job satisfaction, which undermines their motivation to teach. Most importantly, both parents and schools are working in the interest of school children, hence there should be a meeting point that does not put the child in so much discomfort and affect the primary purpose – education. It is based on this premise that this research will focus on examining the pain points of school owners and administrative heads as regards student debts to come up with a solution that will enable them to publicize the debt status of students such that other schools can have access to this database to confirm the status of students before admitting them into their schools.

**Research Objectives:** The aim of this research is to identify the challenges school owners and administrators face as a result of tuition debtors and to establish a solution that will help them publicize the debt status of students and prevent these students from going to other schools. To achieve this aim, this research will be focusing on these objectives:

1. Identify the driving factors for admitting students
2. Understand their pain points and challenges during this process
3. Identify patterns in tracking student debtors
4. Identifying challenges schools face with the patterns/means already in place for tracking debtors?
5. Identifying challenges schools face with the patterns/means already in place for identifying debtors?
6. Isolate the most-used tools and why
7. Uncover potential changes required by the users for seamless use of these applications 
8. Identify the factors that determine whether a child’s info is added to the directory of debtors on the platform

**Research Questions**
- What are the driving factors for admitting students? 
- How often do parents owe schools? 
- What are the means/tools already put in place to identify debtors and not admit them? 
- What are the advantages and setbacks/challenges of these already set means/tools? 
- Do we have already built platforms like this (SDM) already existing? 
- What are the advantages and setbacks/challenges of these already built platforms? 
- What factors determine whether a child is termed “debtor” and has his/her info added to the directory? 
- What if the information is not properly updated due to human error, does this mean a child can lose out on being admitted to another school?
- How do we ensure that information on the directories of schools is accurate?

**Method & Recruiting:** A google form survey will be sent out containing 6 screener questions to identify the ideal user group. These participants will be contacted using the personal network of the project members to reach out to school owners and administrative heads of primary and secondary schools in our area of concentration to gather in-depth qualitative data. 
The selected respondents within the ideal user group will be subjected to a 15-20 minutes interview via any means they choose to gather in-depth qualitative data. I will use the interview script as a guide and ask follow-up questions based on the answers of the users.

There will be 5-7 participants including
- A male that is a  school owner or an administrative head of a primary or secondary school.
- A female that is a  school owner or an administrative head of a primary or secondary school.

## Interview Feedback
A total of five respondents were interviewed which included three males and two females who occupy the position of administrative heads of primary and secondary schools in Lagos mainland. These interviews lasted 13 minutes at the minimum and were held over zoom meeting channels and recorded upon the permission of the respondents. Below is a sample of the interview script of one of the respondents.

**Question:** What city do you live in?  
**Ans:** I live in Lagos, precisely on the mainland, you know Lagos has two worlds so yeah, in Ikeja  

**Question:** What is the name of your school?  
**Ans:** *Name withheld* clue - Idimu Road, Ikeja

**Question:** Could you describe your typical day at school?  
**Ans:** operates the Nigerian/British curriculum, most parents prefer the British curriculum because they are trained out so our school tradition is to incorporate both in our everyday activities.

**Question:** What school activities do you like and why?  
**Ans:** Well, besides my admin duties I also teach math and prepare the students for external competitions and exams so I think what I enjoy most is teaching the students. 

**Question:** How often do you have new students register at your school?  
**Ans:** We register new students every term but mostly during Aug/Sept new academic session and at the end of every term too.

**Question:** Would you say your school is lenient in terms of its admission policies? Why?  
**Ans:** To be honest, I’d say yes because considering the standard of the education we provide they are plus parents are always registering their students especially when they see how our students perform in external exams.

**Question:** When you decide to admit a student, what motivates you or what are the things you consider?  
**Ans:** We consider a lot, but first the financial status of the parents. We give them a form to fill in their occupation and expected annual salary, then we also subject the students to internal examinations and only when they pass these two phases will they be admitted into the school.

**Question:** What is the most frequent class of student you admit into your school?  
**Ans:** I think primary 1 and JSS1 because after the nursery session we have some pupils still continuing and other external students too who want to attend primary school with us, the same thing for secondary. Some of our students if not all decide to continue to secondary with us and we also have external students too. 

**Question:** How many students have you admitted in the last 6 months?  
**Ans:** That I can’t answer from the back of my hand except I check our records but we have had quite a lot of students coming in this period.

**Question:** Can you describe the steps you take when you want to admit these students?  
**Ans:** Like I said before, we give them internal exams to test their academic abilities but these are for the primary and secondary classes, the nursery classes are judged solely by the ability of their parents to pay their fees.

**Aux Question:** And why is that?  
**Ans:** What are you going to ask a 2 year old? They are play groups so we just don’t ask them anything, it’s going to be a waste of our time and resources.  

**Question:** Tell me about a time a student left your school without clearing his/her debts?  
**Ans:** We’ve had several cases about that not just one but I think the one that really caused a stir was when 3 kids of the same parents left at once, it wasn’t just embarrassing but painful because one of them was in my class and was very bright but you just can’t help it, you work for the school not for the kids or their parents.  

**Aux Question:** Do you think the school could have done anything to stop them?  
**Ans:** Well, the school in this sense is me because I take care of those responsibilities , with my assistant and other persons of course but I think we had done all we could, I mean we let three kids of same parents owe fees for two terms and a fee per term is almost a hundred thousand for the secondary section and even more for the primary. Now calculate it for three kids, this is just for one parent, it was too much and there was no sign of payment so we had to do what we did.

**Aux Question** Has the school made any move to claim the money back? If yes, what steps have been taken?  
**Ans:** We have contacted the parents severally but you know most of them don’t pick up especially when they know you call so in serious cases like these the school involves her legal department so currently it’s the responsibility of their lawyers to act on this issue and they are on it.  

**Aux Question:** Do you think these children are currently students of other schools at the moment?  
**Ans:** Yes na, their parents must have registered them elsewhere to continue their education.  

**Aux Question:** Do you think the other school could have done anything to stop them from registering or to clear their debts with you?  
**Ans:** How will they even know they have debts? Nobody will tell them besides, schools need more students, on the mainland here it’s very competitive there are a lot of schools so if you refuse to accept them, another school will.  

**Aux Question:** How often do people leave your school and what can you say is the primary cause?  
**Ans:** People leave every year or say at the end of every term because of graduations but sometimes when parents feel like their children are not getting what they want.  

**Aux Question:** Has there been any time that your school sent out a child because of tuition debts?  
**Ans:** Yes, but it’s not usually a common practice anyway, it happens when the school has seen the debt has lingered for long. 

**Question:** What frustrates you the most each time these students leave without clearing their debts?  
**Ans:** My feedback from the proprietress, my salary, my bonus. Like, we are about 7 that makes up the school management board and when this happens we are hit not only academically by our brightest students leaving but financially. Also, this school is private and we depend on the fees of the students for the daily running of the school and maintenance.

**Question:** What other limitations do you experience when you try to reach out to these students to pay their debts?  
**Ans:** I think the major limitation is the one I said earlier, not being able to reach the parents.  

**Question:** What methods/products do you use to track down student debtors and get back your money?  
**Ans:** We call them on phone, in extreme cases when they don’t pick, we visit their homes because they leave these addresses for us upon registration but you know sometimes they must have changed address and they don’t update their records. But another thing we do is to involve the school lawyers when it gets beyond the management board. Although it’s our school’s policy not to allow a student to owe more than 2 terms.

**Question:** How will you describe the success of this method/product you apply?  
**Ans:** Well, I’ll say to an extent it is successful because we contact these families but when it comes to reclaiming the debts it’s not except when it becomes a legal case.  

**Aux Question:** Do you think there is a better method that can be applied to track these debtors?  
**Ans:** The best is using legal means, we are not in a country where people’s debts hang over their heads everywhere they go. That's why a lot of debts are left unpaid.  

**Question:** Why do you think this method/product is best for you? *Not asked*  
**Question:** What do you think is the worst feature or limitation of this method/product? *Not asked*  
**Question:** Is there something you would like it to have that they don't or a method you would like to apply that you cannot? *Not asked*  
**Question:** Has anyone in the past recommended a better product or method for you? If so, which?  
**Ans:** No, no one has  

**Question:** If you were to have a product that helps you to see the debt status of students before admitting them, what features would you like to see?  
**Ans:** Is there even a product like that? Well if there is I think what I would like to see is the credit worthiness of students. Are they known as debtors? How often do they pay their fees? So that before admitting them I will know their debt status so I don’t admit the wrong students because I want to meet annual targets, because it’s useless when you meet the numbers and not meet the finances associated with it.  

**Question:** Do you think this product can solve the issue of schools admitting students with debts? If yes/no, why?  
**Ans:** I think it will, because if a student leaves a school with debts and goes to register in another school and they tell them there that they cannot accept them in that new school because of the debts they owe in their previous school then they will be forced to pay up.
