## How to Contribute
  1. Create a new branch to make your changes:<br/>
  
     `git checkout -b <your-name/task>`<br/> 
     
      and make the required changes.<br/>
  
  2. Stage the file: <br/>
  
     `git add <your-changed-file>`<br/>
  
  3. Make sure your commit message is detailed with what you changed and where you changed it and commit your file: <br/>
  
    `git commit -m <your-message>`
    
  4. Push your local changes: <br/>
  
     `git push origin <your-branch-name>` <br/>
  
     If an error occurs here, it means that someone has made changes to the original file while you were working. <br/>
    
     Simply run:<br/>
     
     `git pull origin main`  to sync your local file with the current main file<br/>
     
     run `git push origin <your-branch-name>` again.
    
  5. Visit the remote url on Github to create a pull request.
  
  6. Wait for a team member to review your pull request.
  
  7. Merge pull request after review.
